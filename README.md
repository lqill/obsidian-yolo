<h1 align="center">YOLO</h1>
<p align="center">
  Agent-native AI assistant for Obsidian — chat, write, knowledge base, and orchestration, all in one place.


  This fork is adding gemini live api functionality. This will not reach upstream as unfortunately I break the rules like [“I asked the AI to fix it again” iteration loops with no human reasoning visible] and [Author can’t explain a non-trivial part of the diff during review] because i only have basic python knowledge. Hopefully it will not eternally like that as i keep learning :D

## What's New

- **`1.6`**
  - **On-device local embedding models and multiple knowledge bases**: index without any API key, split and manage knowledge bases independently, and let the Agent auto-pick the right one by name.
  - **CLI chat**: on desktop, drive the Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Pi, or Grok CLI you're already signed into from the same chat surface. Grok reuses an official Grok Build CLI login; it does not reuse an xAI API key.
  - **The new Learning Mode**: turn any topic and reference material into a personalized learning project with structured outlines, knowledge points, flashcards, and an interactive knowledge map, backed by FSRS spaced repetition and Anki `.apkg` import for sustainable long-term review.

- **`1.5`**: Introduces a new Agent runtime that turns AI from Q&A into active collaboration—with full tool calling, MCP, Skills, desktop Bash, subagents, and web search—plus smarter long-session context and memory, refreshed hybrid RAG, focus/PDF awareness, and multi-window chat with background Agents.

## Features

Beyond the core capabilities above, YOLO also provides:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🖥️ CLI Agent (Desktop) | Reuse a supported locally signed-in CLI agent, including Claude Code, Codex, Hermes, Pi, and Grok, right inside Obsidian |
| 🔌 External Agent Support | Connect MCP clients such as Hermes and OpenClaw to YOLO's Vault search, or delegate tasks to a configured YOLO Agent |
| ⚡ Quick Ask | Ask, edit, and continue writing without leaving the editor |
| 🔎 Vault RAG | Retrieve across your Vault for answers grounded in your own notes |
| 🪟 Multi-Window Chat | Run different tasks and contexts in parallel across independent chat windows |
| 🧠 Memory System | Lets YOLO remember preferences, habits, and long-term context for more consistent conversations |
| 🪡 Cursor Chat | One-click context addition, conversation at your fingertips |
| ⌨️ Tab Completion | Real-time AI-powered completion for smoother, more natural writing |
| 🎛️ Multi-Model Support | OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek and other mainstream models, freely switch |
| 🌍 i18n | Native multi-language support |

## Quick Start

1. Open Obsidian Settings → Community Plugins → Browse → Search **"YOLO"**
2. Install and enable
3. Configure your API key in plugin settings, or use your own ChatGPT OAuth / Gemini OAuth:
   - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) / [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) / [Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) / [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys)
4. Open the sidebar to start chatting — or try Quick Ask by typing `@` in the editor

For Grok subscription CLI chat on desktop, install [Grok Build](https://docs.x.ai/build) and run `grok login` (or `grok login --device-auth`) in a terminal first. YOLO asks the official CLI to reuse that cached login and does not copy its OAuth tokens into the Vault. The plugin starts a dedicated Grok ACP process in its default ask-first permission mode; YOLO auto-approval is not offered for this runtime.

## Installation

### Community Plugin Store (Recommended)

See Quick Start above.

### Manual Installation

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Lapis0x0/obsidian-yolo/releases) and download the latest `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`
2. Create folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-yolo/`
3. Copy files to that folder, then enable the plugin in Obsidian Settings

> [!WARNING]
> YOLO cannot coexist with [Smart Composer](https://github.com/glowingjade/obsidian-smart-composer). Please disable or uninstall Smart Composer before using YOLO.

## Roadmap

- [x] Better and stronger Vault AI search
- [x] Background Agent (long-running task automation)
- [x] Multi-Agent orchestration (via subagents)
- [x] Learning Mode — a dedicated study view
- [ ] Annotation Mode — real-time AI annotations and suggestions on notes
- [ ] Built-in assistant — a corner-pinned helper for config/agents, with auto-compaction and scheduled tasks
- [ ] Better AI whiteboard
- [ ] Voice input & meeting notes

## Feedback & Issues

Hit a bug, something confusing, or have an idea? Open an issue:

🐛 [Report a bug](https://github.com/Lapis0x0/obsidian-yolo/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) · ✨ [Request a feature](https://github.com/Lapis0x0/obsidian-yolo/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)

What helps:

- Bug reports with a clear reproduction (Obsidian version, OS, plugin version, what you did, what happened)
- "I tried X and got Y" reports — UX papercuts, confusing wording, broken docs, outdated translations
- Concrete feature ideas tied to a real use case ("when I do A, I want B because C")

Please search existing issues first to avoid duplicates.

## Contributing

All forms of contribution are welcome — bug reports, documentation improvements, feature enhancements.

**Please open an issue first to discuss feasibility and implementation for major features.**

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide: what we welcome, AI-assisted PR policy, size guidelines, and dev setup.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Smart Composer](https://github.com/glowingjade/obsidian-smart-composer) for the original work — without them, there would be no YOLO.

Special thanks to [Kilo Code](https://kilo.ai) for their sponsorship. Kilo is an open-source AI coding assistant platform with 500+ AI models, helping developers build and iterate faster.
