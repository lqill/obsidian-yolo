// Rung one of the board's AI ladder: an empty text card offers
// a few one-click instructions, and clicking one streams a single agent turn
// straight into that card.
//
// Two states of one card, and that is the whole surface:
//
//   - **empty** — while it is the card the user is on (selected alone, or
//     being edited), its body holds a placeholder line whose instruction
//     words are the chips. Not an overlay and not a button beside the card:
//     a card with nothing in it is a card asking what goes in it, and a
//     placeholder is what that looks like. The first character
//     typed into the card takes them away (`syncChips` is called from the same
//     content path that renders every other card state, so "has content" is
//     never asked twice).
//     An open editor does not end that state, it *is* it: a card created by
//     dragging an arrow opens its editor immediately, and chips that waited
//     for the editor to close would mean the main gesture of rung one never
//     showed them. So the chips sit in the body next to the editor for as
//     long as what is typed in it is still empty — caret and chips at once,
//     type or click. Pressing a chip must not be read as leaving the editor
//     first, so a chip holds the focus through `mousedown` (`preventDefault`)
//     and lets its own `click` be what closes the editor, in that order.
//   - **generating** — the body holds a status line and the text as it
//     arrives. Nothing is written to the board while it streams: the card is
//     pinned, the renderer is told to leave it alone, and the accumulated text
//     lands in one `applyBoardChange` when the run settles, so Cmd+Z undoes a
//     generation in one step.
//
// Stopping keeps what has arrived, and so does double-clicking into the card
// mid-run — the editor and the stream share the card's body, so
// asking to type in it is asking to stop.
//
// The run itself is deliberately small: `host.agent.stream` with a system
// prompt that *replaces* the host's default one, the card's context as
// the prompt (domain/cardContext.ts), and exactly one run-scoped read-only
// tool. No writes, no board tools, no follow-up turn.
