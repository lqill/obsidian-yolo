  // the card; editing is a second, deliberate step — a second click on the
  // selected card, a double-click (which is the same two clicks, quickly),
  // or Enter on the selection. The second click is Miro's and Figma's, and
  // the one a touch screen can do: a double-tap is nobody's instinct there. Selecting first is
  // what makes a single click safe: the card can then be dragged, deleted,
  // resized or wired up without a caret landing in it and an editor
  // mounting on every glance. A brand-new card is the exception and opens
  // straight into editing — there is nothing in it to select.
  // A drag moves either just the pressed card, or the whole
  // current selection if the pressed card was already part of it (and
  // never enters edit mode). Position updates during drag write only
  // `transform` on the affected card elements (compositor-friendly, no
  // layout write) — `left`/`top` are reconciled to the final board values
  // once on drop, matching how a freshly-mounted card is positioned.

  // the editor rather than do nothing. Once it does move, every frame writes
  // `left`/`top`/`width`/`height` on the one card being resized: unlike a
