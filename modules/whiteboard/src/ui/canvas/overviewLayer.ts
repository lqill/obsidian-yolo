// The overview tier's renderer for the `.yoloboard` canvas: one `<canvas>`
// that draws every card and edge itself, replacing their DOM entirely below
// OVERVIEW_SCALE_THRESHOLD.
//
// Why a canvas at all, on a board whose whole rendering architecture is DOM:
// the measured ceiling is not what a card *contains* but that it exists.
// `PaintArtifactCompositor::Update` — Blink handing its paint artifacts to the
// compositor — grows with the number of mounted elements whatever they hold,
// and at 1200 mounted cards it alone eats most of a frame. That number is
// bounded at readable zooms because a screen only holds so many cards; below
// ~0.15 it is not. So the fix is not to make the cards cheaper, it is for
// there to be no cards: at that zoom nothing in one is legible anyway, and a
// few thousand rectangles is an afternoon's work for a canvas.
//
// Screen space, not world space. The canvas is a sibling of the world layer
// rather than a child: inside it, the camera's CSS `scale` would blur the
// bitmap and force a re-raster on every zoom frame. Here it is redrawn instead
// — which costs a pass over the board data per frame and nothing at rest.
//
// Groups deliberately stay in the DOM at every tier: there are a few
// dozen of them, they are the most common thing to drag at this zoom, and
// keeping them means dragging one needs no new code. That is also why the
// canvas is inserted *before* the world layer: groups paint over it, as they
// do the cards in every other tier, and so do the snap guides, the resize
// handles and an in-flight connection's curve.
//
// `WhiteboardCanvas` is the only importer; this module must never import it
// back (single-direction dependency between the canvas and its collaborators).
