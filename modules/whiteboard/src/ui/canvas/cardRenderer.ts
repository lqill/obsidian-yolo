   * Puts markdown on a card through the one content path both card types

   *
   * The prefix is the whole design. A card clips and does not scroll, so it
   * was only ever going to display its first screenful — but the renderer was
   * being handed the entire note, and paying a parse, an image decode and a
   * post-processor pass over all of it. The windowed preview this used to use
   * bounded what stayed *mounted*, not what got built: it measures every
   * section to know its own height, so a long note cost the whole document on
   * every remount anyway (measured 2026-09-01: 6.3ms a card against 1.06ms
   * for a short one, and 223k transient nodes on a 300-card board). Asking
   * for a prefix bounds the build itself, and makes a card's cost a property
   * of its own geometry rather than of the note behind it.
   *
   * `MarkdownRenderer.render` also happens to be the published API, where the
   * windowed preview reaches into shape Obsidian does not publish
   * (obsidianMarkdownContentView.ts). What the one-pass path does not carry is
   * a view's *behaviour* — an internal link renders but nothing wires its
   * click or its hover preview — which costs a card nothing: everything inside
   * a card that is not being edited is unhittable by design (style.css's
   * content mask).
   *
   * This is the one expensive thing the canvas does per card, and so the one
   * place besides the drain that asks whether this frame may build. It has to
   * ask again here: a note card gets this far only after reading its file,
   * which is one or more frames after the drain that let it start. On a frame
   * that may not build, the card goes back on the queue — its frame is on
   * screen, its text arrives a frame or two later, which is what paying for a
   * long note looks like when the paying is paced.
