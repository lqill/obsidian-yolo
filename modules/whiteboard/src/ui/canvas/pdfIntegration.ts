// Everything that joins PDF reading to the board: the reading panel and the
// card it reads, the annotation controller over the whole view, excerpts, a
// click on a link into one of this board's PDFs, the reader's own keys, and
// the reading position written back to the card.
//
// Split out of `../canvas.ts` (no behaviour change). The canvas still owns the
// board, its history and the selection; this class owns only the panel, the
// annotation chrome and their bookkeeping, and reaches the board through
// `CanvasCore`. `WhiteboardCanvas` is the only importer; this module must
// never import it back.
//
// Reading panel. One PDF card at a time is read in a column beside the board
// (../pdf/readerPanel.ts) — a second reader over the card's file.
//
// The two readers are read apart: the panel opens where the card is (or at
// the passage a link names), and from then on neither follows the other — a
// card left at one page while the panel reads another is two places being
// read, not one place shown twice. The node's `startPage` is the card's own
// position (the canvas's `commitReadingWindow`); the panel keeps none.
//
// The board makes room rather than being covered: its viewport's right edge
// moves in by the panel's width, and everything measured against the
// viewport — the camera's zoom floor, virtualization, the toolbar's clamp, the
// overview canvas — is re-measured through the canvas's `onResize`.
// Hit-testing reads the viewport's own client rect, whose left edge never
// moves.
