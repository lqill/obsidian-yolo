// Excerpting from a PDF onto the board it is read on: a quote, an
// annotation's comment, or a framed area as a picture, becomes bare text written on the board
// (../../domain/excerpt.ts has the markdown and why) citing its page with
// Obsidian's own link.
//
// Bare text rather than a card: an excerpt is a line taken down beside the
// reading, not a document of its own, and a frame around every one of them
// turned a board of notes into a board of boxes. It is still a text node — it
// turns into a card from its menu, and a reader that does not know bare text
// shows it as one (fileFormat.ts's `TextDisplay`).
//
// An excerpt is only text. Nothing binds it to the PDF, to a highlight it
// may have been taken from, or to the annotation file: the drag that made
// it may leave the passage marked (../pdf/annotationController.ts), but
// deleting either never touches the other (design.md §0). It is undone like
// anything made on the board.
//
// Where it goes: dropped, where it was dropped; otherwise beside the PDF card
// it came from — the column right of the card, the next free slot down
// (../../domain/placement.ts's `placeBeside`), so a run of excerpts from one
// PDF stacks there rather than piling up or wandering off. The card is not
// selected: selecting it would take the focus off the PDF card, and with it
// the text layers the reader is reading on. It is announced only when it
// landed out of sight.
