// A self-contained PDF reader: one vault PDF as a continuous column of pages,
// drawn through the Host API's `pdf` facade. The whiteboard's PDF card is one
// instance (ui/canvas/cardRenderer.ts); the in-view reading panel is meant to
// be another over the same file, so nothing here knows about cards, the board
// or the camera — whoever mounts it says how much it is being zoomed
// (`setViewScale`), whether it is the one being read (`setInteractive`), and
// whether the frame it is in may take on work (`canStartWork`).
//
// Why not pdf.js's own `PDFViewer`: it owns scrolling, virtualization and
// resize observation for its container, which is exactly what the board
// already does for its cards; two of those nested inside each other fight
// (see design.md §3).
//
// Pages are virtualized. Every page has a sized placeholder, so the column is
// the document's real height and the scroll position means what it says; only
// pages near the reader's viewport get a canvas (and, while interactive, a
// text layer), and pages scrolled far away give theirs back along with what
// the engine held for drawing them (`page.cleanup`).
//
// Sharpness under zoom: the reader lays pages out in its own layout pixels,
// which the transform around it scales. A pan or zoom only moves that
// transform; once the zoom has held still for ZOOM_SETTLE_MS the visible
// pages are redrawn at the density the screen now shows them at. The engine
// keeps the previous picture until the new one is complete, so a redraw never
// flashes, and a new draw into a canvas cancels the one it supersedes.
//
// Every DOM object comes from the container's own document and window, so a
// reader in a popout window draws, observes and schedules in that window.
//
// Two readers over one file — a card and the view's reading panel — follow
// each other through `onPositionChange` and `setPosition`. `setPosition` is
// the follower's half and is silent: the scroll it causes is not reported
// back, so the two cannot bounce a position between them.
//
// Annotations: given the PDF's annotation store (../../host/annotationStore.
// ts), every drawn page carries a layer of them between its picture and its
// text layer (./annotationLayer.ts), repainted whenever the store changes —
// which is how a highlight made in one reader appears in every other. What
// the reader reports is only what happened on its pages: text selected, an
// annotation clicked, an area framed. What to do about it (the toolbar, the
// store edits) is the owner's (./annotationController.ts).
