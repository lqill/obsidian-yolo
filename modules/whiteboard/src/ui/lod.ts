 * group node never shows one: its label is chrome, drawn at every zoom, so
 * this returns it unchanged for the callers that ask.
 *
 * A text node's leading `#` markers are dropped: the line is being shown as
 * a title, not as markdown, and a card that opens with a heading — the most
 * common way to title one — would otherwise wear its syntax in the one place
 * the syntax is never rendered. Only the heading marker goes; a first line
 * that starts with a bullet or a quote is prose the user wrote that way.
 *
 * A PDF card read past its first page also says which page it is on
 * (`pageLabels.card`, the caller's localized "name · p. N"), because below
 * the threshold that is all a card has to say about where its reader was —
 * and a board of papers is exactly the board zoomed out to find one. A

 * The slice of a card's markdown that its body can actually show.

 * does not scroll (style.css's content mask), so the renderer only ever
 * needs that much source — see constants.ts's CARD_CONTENT_MIN_LINE_WORLD_PX
 * for why a line budget derived from the height cannot come up short.
 * Everything outside the window is parsed, post-processed and laid out for a
 * reader who has no way to reach it.
 *
 * Counted in *source lines*, not characters, because that is the unit whose
 * relationship to rendered height is knowable: every non-blank source line
 * renders as at least one line box, while a character count says nothing
 * about how tall anything is. Blank lines are kept but not counted — they
 * separate blocks rather than occupying height, and a run of them would
 * otherwise eat the budget and leave the card half empty.
 *
 * The two ends are not symmetric. The *end* only ever cuts: what it leaves
 * open — an unterminated fence, half a table — renders as the partial block
 * it is, which is exactly what the card was going to show of it anyway. The
 * *start* cannot be so casual: begin inside a fenced block and its closing
 * fence reads as an opening one, so the rest of the card renders as code.
 * `blockStartAtOrBefore` therefore backs the start up to the nearest block
 * boundary, which is also the more honest place to begin reading.
