// The vault half of a card's context: read what the pure
// assembly in `domain/cardContext.ts` needs, then build it.
//
// The async boundary sits exactly here. Reading files is the only thing about
// a card's context that cannot be answered from the board, so it is the only
// thing that awaits — everything downstream of `resolveCardContextNotes` is
// synchronous and can be re-run against a board that has since changed
// without touching the vault again. That is what a synchronous consumer
// (Quick Ask's `getContext`) is meant to hold: the notes, resolved once,
// and `buildCardContext` called on demand.
//
// Two reads per note in the worst case (a clipped preview for the summary,
// the whole file for a source) and one for every other note card. Sources are
// a handful of cards by construction — they are what someone drew an arrow
// from — so the whole-file reads are bounded by the user's own gesture, not
// by the board.
