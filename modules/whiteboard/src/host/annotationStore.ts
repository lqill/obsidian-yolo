// The annotations of one PDF, shared by everything showing that PDF, and the
// file they live in (../domain/pdfAnnotations.ts).
//
// One `AnnotationStore` per PDF path at a time, handed out by the module's
// `AnnotationStores` and counted: every reader over the PDF — its card, the
// view's reading panel, the same PDF on another open board — holds the same
// store and repaints from the same change, so a highlight made in one is in
// all of them at once. The last reader to let go writes what is pending and
// the store goes.
//
// The file is read and written whole. Changes are written once they have
// paused for WRITE_DELAY_MS, and at once when the store is let go. A change
// to the file from anywhere else (sync, another device, a hand edit) is read
// back in and replaces what is shown; our own writes come back as modify
// events too, and are recognized by their content — the text we last wrote
// — rather than by timing, which a slow disk or a sync client would fool.
//
// A file this version cannot read — a later version's, or one that is not an
// annotation file — is never written: what could be read of it is shown, and
// editing is refused rather than allowed to overwrite it.
//
// The PDF's file lifecycle is followed here too, for open and closed PDFs
// alike, since a PDF can be renamed or deleted while no board shows it:
//   - rename or move: the annotation file is renamed with it, and a live
//     store keeps working under the new path (a board that follows the
//     rename to the new path gets the same store back);
//   - delete: the annotation file goes to the trash with it — the user's
//     trash, by the user's deletion setting, so restoring the PDF from the
//     trash can restore its annotations beside it. Keeping it instead would
//     leave an invisible file (Obsidian's explorer hides .json by default)
//     describing a PDF that is gone, and silently attach it to any unrelated
//     PDF later saved under that name.
