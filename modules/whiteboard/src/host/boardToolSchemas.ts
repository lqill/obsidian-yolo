// The two tools' JSON Schemas and descriptions, kept apart from the handlers
// so neither file has to be read to understand the other.
//
// These strings are the model's entire documentation for a whiteboard, and
// they are written for a reader who has just loaded them on demand and has
// never seen a board before. Two things they deliberately do *not* do:
//
//   - describe the file format. A model that knows a board is JSON will reach
//     for `fs_edit`, which is exactly what is blocked. Cards, connections and
//     groups are the vocabulary; JSON never appears.
//   - offer more than one way to do anything. There is no `disconnect` (an id
//     says what it is, so `delete` covers it), no `ungroup` (a group is a
//     card, so deleting it dissolves it), and no layout language beyond
//     `arrange` and plain coordinates.
//
// Not localized: they are read by a model, not by the user.

/**
 * What a default card holds, so the model has a sense of scale before it
 * writes rather than a `w×h` it cannot interpret.
 *
 * A board is a spatial medium: the model is not filling fields, it is laying
 * out a page. How much text belongs on one card, whether a thought is one card
 * or two, whether three cards side by side will look balanced — every one of
 * those judgements happens before a single character is written, and none of
 * them is possible from a pixel count alone. One anchor is enough; the model
 * extrapolates from it better than it reads a table.
 *
 * Measured, not derived: rendered in a real card scaled to 260x156, a plain
 * paragraph at 13px on a 19.5px line takes 7 lines, holding 119 Chinese
 * characters or 210 of English. Rounded down here because real markdown
 * carries heading and paragraph spacing that plain prose does not. These
 * numbers describe NEW_CARD_SIZE specifically — change NEW_CARD_CELLS and they
 * have to be measured again.
