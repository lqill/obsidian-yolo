// What a board looks like to a model — the text `fs_read` returns for a
// `.yoloboard` and the text an @mention injects, in place of the file itself.
//
// The raw file is a JSON Canvas superset: `extra` bags, `fromEnd`/`toEnd`,
// `version`, `camera`, and one object per node. A 300-card board is hundreds
// of KB of that, almost all of it machine state the model must not touch. So
// this is not a pretty-printer — it is a *reduction*, and what it keeps is
// exactly what the two things a model does with a board need:
//
//   - understanding it: what each card says, what points at what, what is
//     grouped with what;
//   - editing it: the ids `edit_board` addresses, and the coordinates that
//     make "put this to the right of that" expressible.
//
// Coordinates are given rather than hidden. They are the only real spatial
// information a board has — a serialization in reading order would be a
// lossy re-encoding of the same thing — and `edit_board` already accepts
// coordinates on the way in, so withholding them on the way out would leave
// the model able to write something it cannot read back.
//
// **Every card is previewed, none is given in full.** Reading a board is
// reading its shape; reading a card is reading its text, and that is a
// separate request (`readBoardCard`, reached as `board.yoloboard#c-8f3a`).
// The alternative — text cards verbatim because their content has no other
// exit, file cards clipped because `fs_read` can reach theirs — makes the
// cost of reading a board scale with everything ever written on it, and
// leaves the model unable to tell whether what it is holding is the whole
// card. One rule, stated in the output, is worth more than a rule that is
// cleverer per card.
//
// Zero DOM, zero host, zero I/O (Module Boundaries): a file card's preview
// lives in another vault file, so the caller resolves those and passes them
// in. `host/boardSummary.ts` is what does that reading.
