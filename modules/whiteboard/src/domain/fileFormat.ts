// `.yoloboard` schema v1 — the single point that knows this file format.
//
// The format is a **superset of JSON Canvas 1.0** (https://jsoncanvas.org/
// spec/1.0/). Every concept Canvas has, we spell the way Canvas spells it:
//
//   - one flat `nodes` array holding `text` / `file` / `link` / `group` nodes, rather
//     than a `cards` array beside a separate `groups` collection — a group is
//     a kind of node, not a second population;
//   - `color` is a node (and edge) attribute, with Canvas's `canvasColor`
//     values: the presets "1".."6", or a hex string;
//   - edges name their ends `fromNode`/`toNode`, their anchors
//     `fromSide`/`toSide`, and their arrowheads `fromEnd`/`toEnd`, with
//     Canvas's defaults (no arrow at the source, an arrow at the target).
//
// Two deliberate deviations:
//   - geometry is `w`/`h`, not Canvas's `width`/`height` (an abbreviation, not
//     a different concept; renaming would churn every geometry helper for no
//     conceptual gain);
//   - we add `version` and `camera` at the top level — the viewport state
//     Canvas cannot hold is one of the reasons this is our own format.
//
// Everything else Canvas defines but we do not yet render (`subpath` on file
// nodes, `background`/`backgroundStyle` on groups) round-trips untouched
// through the `extra` bag below, so an import loses nothing.
//
// Zero dependencies, no host/DOM/Obsidian imports (Module Boundaries,
// CLAUDE.md): this file is pure data-in, data-out.
//
// Forward compatibility: an unrecognized field at the file, node, or edge
// level is preserved verbatim on parse (in an `extra` bag) and written back
// on serialize, so a future schema addition round-trips through an older
// build of this module without data loss.
