// Where a card goes when nobody said where — the other half of `edit_board`'s
// optional coordinates.
//
// This is the *only* thing a caller cannot express with coordinates, which is
// why it is the only placement behaviour that exists. There is no anchor, no
// direction, no grid and no column count: every one of those says something
// an `x` and a `y` already say, and offering both would make a caller choose
// between two spellings of one thing and leave two paths to keep in step.
// What coordinates genuinely cannot say is "somewhere sensible, not on top of
// anything" — so that is what this answers, and nothing else.
//
// The rule: start beside what the card should follow (the one before it in
// the same batch, or everything already on the board), then step right until
// it fits.
//
// The prohibition: **never move a node that is already there.** Pushing
// neighbours aside to make room is a re-layout nobody asked for, and
// re-layout is open only to an explicit request (`arrange`). So placement
// searches for space; it never makes space. The worst it can do is put a card
// further away than the prettiest spot.
//
// Groups are not obstacles. A group is a frame drawn behind its members, and
// membership is geometric — landing a new card inside one is how a card joins
// it, so treating the frame as occupied would make "add this to that group"
// impossible to express.
