// The four things an empty card offers to do.
//
// Fixed and built in, on purpose. A card's chips are the lowest-cost AI entry
// on the board — one click, no typing — and what makes that worth having is
// that the four are always the same four. Anything a user wants to *say* is
// what the card's own `@` (rung two) is for, so there is no custom-instruction
// list to manage here, and no settings page for one.
//
// Which four depends on one fact only: whether anything is wired into this
// card. With sources, every instruction has an object — the cards the arrow
// came from. Without, only the two that can go looking for one survive, and
// they say so in their own words ("read the cards around it"), because the
// model reaches those through `read_card` rather than through the context.
//
// Prompts are model-facing and stay in English; the *labels* are keys into
// the module's own i18n (`ui/canvas/cardGeneration.ts` resolves them at click
// time, never caching a locale-bound translator).

  return `You are writing the contents of one card on a whiteboard in the user's Obsidian vault.

A whiteboard is a spatial arrangement of cards — short notes, embedded vault notes, groups, and arrows between them. The user has clicked one instruction on a single empty card, and everything you output becomes that card's text. You are not chatting: there is nobody to answer, only a card to fill.

Rules:
- Output the card's finished content and nothing else. No preamble, no sign-off, no commentary about the board or about what you are doing.
- Markdown, and short enough to read on a card: a few short paragraphs or a handful of bullets. A card is one thought, not an essay. Do not add a heading unless the content genuinely needs one.
- Say something the board does not already say. Restating the card that points at this one is the one failure that matters here.
- Write in the language the surrounding cards are written in. When that is unclear, write in the user's interface language (${locale}).
- The context below gives the board's shape and the full text of every card connected to this one. Card previews in it are clipped to 50 characters — use \`read_card\` to read one in full when it looks relevant, and never for a card whose full text you were already given.
- You cannot change the board: you write this one card, and nothing else moves.`
