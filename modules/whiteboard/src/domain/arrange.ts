// Alignment and even distribution for a multi-node selection — pure
// geometry, no DOM and no Board (Module Boundaries, CLAUDE.md: domain/ stays
// dependency-free). ui/canvas.ts turns the returned
// positions into one `setNodePositions` call, i.e. one undo step per action.
//
// Both operations are Obsidian Canvas's own, read off its running
// `menu.render` closure (1.13.7) rather than reinvented — a board that arrives
// by `.canvas` import should rearrange the way its author expects:
//
//   - align moves each node to an edge (or centre line) of the selection's
//     bounding box, on one axis only, leaving the other axis alone;
//   - distribute keeps the two outermost nodes where they are and spreads the
//     rest so the *gaps* between neighbours are equal — equal spacing, not
//     equal centre-to-centre pitch, which is what makes a row of differently
//     sized cards read as evenly placed.
//
// Canvas's "arrange horizontally/vertically/as grid" and "justify" are
// deliberately not here: those reflow or resize a selection rather than align
// it, and are a different feature from alignment and distribution.
