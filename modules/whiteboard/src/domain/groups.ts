// Membership is **spatial, not stored**: a node belongs to a group while it
// sits inside the group's rectangle, and stops belonging the moment either one
// moves. There is no parent field on a node and nothing to keep in sync — the
// same model Obsidian Canvas uses, verified against its running 1.13.7 build,
// where `getContainingNodes` re-runs a spatial query every time a group is
// grabbed:
//
//   getContainingNodes = function(e){ return this.nodeIndex.search(e)
//     .filter(function(t){ return L8(e, t.getBBox()) }) }
//   function L8(e,t){ return e.minX<=t.minX && e.minY<=t.minY
//     && e.maxX>=t.maxX && e.maxY>=t.maxY }
//
// `L8` is **full containment** — a node hanging half out of a group is not in
// it. Copied rather than chosen: centre-point containment would carry away a
// card whose visible bulk is outside the frame, and intersection would carry
// away anything the frame merely grazed.
