// Rename-reference rewrite — the pure half of the "event layer" reference
// resilience insurance ("监听 vault rename 事件，改写所有 .yoloboard...中
// 对该路径的引用"). The host side (src/host/renameRewriter.ts) does the vault
// scanning/read/write I/O; this module only decides *whether* and *how* a
// given board's card `file` references change for a single rename, so the
// decision is testable without any vault fixture.

/**
 * Rewrites every `file` node whose `file` equals `oldPath` to `newPath`.
 * Returns `null` when the board has no such reference at all — the caller's
 * contract (src/host/renameRewriter.ts) is "don't write back a file with
 * nothing to change", so `null` doubles as that signal. Nodes that aren't
 * touched keep their original object reference (the repo's "reference changes
 * iff content changes" invariant, same as operations.ts).
