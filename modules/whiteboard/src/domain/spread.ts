// A PDF card spread out as pages (fileFormat.ts's `PdfSpread`) — how the one
// node a file holds becomes the several things the board moves, and back.
//
// The file keeps a PDF as one node: its rectangle is the reader card's, and
// an open spread is a field on it. The board cannot work with that. Every
// piece of it that reasons about space — virtualization, hit-testing, snapping,
// group membership, edges, placement, tidying — asks a node for one rectangle,
// and a spread is a title plus a sheet per page, each placed on its own.
//
// So the board is given a different, equivalent shape (`expandBoard`): while a
// spread is open its node *is its title* — same id, the title's rectangle —
// and every page is a `pdf-page` node of its own. Whatever the board already
// does for a card it now does for a sheet, and what it does for the node it
// does for the document as a whole: a group holds the PDF when it holds the
// title, an edge to the node reaches the whole PDF, deleting the node deletes
// all of it. The few rules that are about the document rather than a rectangle
// — a sheet moves with its title, a sheet alone cannot be deleted — are the
// helpers at the bottom of this file.
//
// `collapseBoard` is the inverse, and is what is written. Both are total and
// pure, and `collapseBoard(expandBoard(b))` is `b`.
//
// Zero dependencies beyond the file format (Module Boundaries, CLAUDE.md).
