// Undo/redo for a board, as a linear stack of whole-board snapshots.
//
// Snapshots rather than inverse operations, because a snapshot here is almost
// free: every mutation goes through domain/operations.ts, which returns a new
// Board sharing every object it did not change (the repository's "an object's
// reference changes if and only if its content changes" rule). Two snapshots
// either side of a card move differ by one card object and two arrays — not by
// a copy of the board. Inverse operations would buy nothing for that price and
// would need an undo written, and kept correct, for every future primitive.
// (Obsidian Canvas keeps whole-data snapshots for the same reason.)
//
// Deliberately ignorant of the camera: what belongs in a snapshot is decided
// by the caller, and the canvas restores the live camera over whatever a
// snapshot carries — a viewport that jumps away is the least welcome thing an
// undo can do.
//
// DOM-free like every other domain/ module, so the whole undo model is
// testable without a canvas.
