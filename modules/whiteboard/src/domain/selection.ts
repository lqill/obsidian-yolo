// Pure marquee-selection math: normalizing a drag gesture's two corner
// points into a world-space rectangle, and hit-testing board nodes against
// it ("框选"). The canvas UI (src/ui/canvas.ts) owns the actual overlay div
// and the screen->world conversion (via ./camera's `screenToWorld`) — this
// module only ever sees plain world-space points/rects, keeping it DOM-free
// like every other domain/ module.
//
// Selection itself (which ids are currently selected) is UI state, not board
// data (it has no `.yoloboard` representation) — this module never touches
// `Board`, only plain rects.
