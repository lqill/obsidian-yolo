// Pure-logic viewport virtualization engine, migrated from the S1/S2 spikes
// (algorithm ported unchanged from `git show
// spike/s2-editor-lifecycle:src/features/whiteboard-spike/virtualization.ts`
// per that spike's "对正式实现的架构建议" #1 and #3):
//   - input is {cards, viewportRect, pinnedIds}, output is a
//     {toMount, toUnmount} diff — no DOM dependency, so swapping the mount
//     consumer (innerHTML -> MarkdownRenderer -> React, etc.) never requires
//     touching this module.
//   - "currently interacting" cards (dragged, edited, selected, ...) are
//     exempted from the unload decision via a generic `pinnedIds` set rather
//     than a one-off drag special-case.
//
// Recompute throttling (~70ms) and per-frame drain quotas
// are *not* this module's job — those are host-loop concerns owned by the
// (not-yet-built) canvas UI, which calls `recompute()` on a debounce and
// `drain()` once per animation frame.
