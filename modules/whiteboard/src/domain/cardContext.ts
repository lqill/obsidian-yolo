// What one card knows about where it lives — the text handed to a model that
// is about to write, or answer a question about, a single card.
//
// Three parts, and the split is the whole design:
//
//   1. **The board, summarized** — `summarizeBoard`, unchanged: every card's
//      id, kind, coordinates and 50-character preview, plus groups and edges.
//      It is a map, not a reading: what it tells the model is which cards
//      exist and which one to reach for next.
//   2. **This card**, by id and position, because everything the model does
//      is relative to it.
//   3. **Its sources, in full** — a card wired *into* this one is the one
//      thing the user has already said belongs here, so it is the one thing
//      given without being asked for. A 50-character preview of the card
//      someone just dragged an arrow from is a preview of the whole task.
//
// Everything else stays a preview and is read on demand (`read_card`). That
// is what keeps the cost of this text bounded by the board's *shape* rather
// than by everything ever written on it — the same rule `summarizeBoard`
// states in its own output.
//
// Pure and I/O-free (Module Boundaries): a note card's text lives in another
// vault file, so the caller reads those and passes them in — `host/
// cardContext.ts` is what does that reading. Keeping the assembly pure is
// also what lets a caller that already holds the texts (a synchronous
// `getContext`) build the same string without awaiting anything.
