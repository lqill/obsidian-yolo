/**
 * v81 -> v82: knowledge bases become independent (multi-vector-store)
 * entities instead of one implicit "the vault" index scoped by
 * `ragOptions.includePatterns`/`excludePatterns`/`excludeYoloBaseDir`.
 * Those three fields, plus
 * the long-dead `continuationOptions.knowledgeBaseFolders`, are dropped.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT synthesize a default `knowledgeBases` entry from the
 * old include/exclude patterns: each knowledge base now owns its own
 * IndexedDB-backed vector store, so any pre-existing index has to be
 * rebuilt from scratch regardless of whether a base is auto-created here.
 * Forcing the user to create their first base explicitly avoids guessing a
 * name/description on their behalf. `knowledgeBases` is left absent so the
 * settings schema's own default (`[]`) fills it in.
