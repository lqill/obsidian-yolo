/**
 * Per-tool-call context a custom renderer needs to mount. Assembled and
 * handed down by the caller (ToolMessage.tsx).
 *
 * Shape decided against `delegate_subagent`'s `SubagentCard`, the upper
 * bound of what a custom card needs:
 *   - `toolCallId` / `request` / `response` / `conversationId`: plain values
 *     already threaded through ToolMessage.tsx's per-call render function.
 *   - `subagentResult`: message-tree-derived (looked up from a
 *     `Map<toolCallId, ChatSubagentResultMessage>` assembled above the
 *     per-call level, `ToolMessage.tsx`'s `subagentResultsByToolCallId`) —
 *     a renderer mounted from just `(request, response)` could not derive
 *     this itself.
 *   - `onAbort`: closes over `useChatRuntimeActions()` and the active
 *     conversation/recovery state — likewise not independently derivable.
 *
 * Extending this bag with more optional fields as later tools need them is
 * additive and does not require revisiting this shape or any existing
 * renderer. `terminalCommandResult` is the first such addition —
 * `terminal_command`'s `body` renderer needs it to hydrate a live/persisted
 * background-session result, mirroring `subagentResult` above.

/**
 * A tool's chat-surface header summary — the short text after the title in

 * function of the call's *arguments* — no React, no response data — which is
 * why its implementations live beside each tool's `definition.ts` in
 * `core/tools/<tool>/chat-summary.ts` rather than in a `ui.tsx`: they
 * need no more from the UI layer than `ui.tsx` files are explicitly allowed
 * to avoid (`definition.ts` never imports `ui.tsx`).
 *
 * `labels` is declared here as a plain structural echo of the handful of
 * translated strings any summary function needs (currently: `todo_write`'s
 * four list-state strings, `terminal_command`'s three session-follow-up
 * strings) — NOT an import of `ToolMessage.tsx`'s `ToolLabels`. Importing
 * that type would create a components -> components cycle the moment
 * `ToolMessage.tsx` itself imports `TOOL_RENDERERS`, since
 * a component-scoped type-only import is still an edge this project's
 * circular-dependency check counts (see `core/tools/types.ts`'s
 * `OpaqueSubagentParentContext` doc comment for the same reasoning applied
 * to a core/core edge). The real `ToolLabels` object is a structural
 * superset of `ToolChatSummaryLabels`, so it satisfies this type without
 * either side importing the other; each concrete `summary` function further
 * narrows `labels` down to only the fields it actually reads (see
 * `terminal_command/chat-summary.ts` / `todo_write/chat-summary.ts`).
 *
 * Returns `undefined` for "no summary" on a particular call — e.g. an empty
 * query. A tool that should never show one declares `summary: null` instead
 * of omitting the field; see `ToolRenderer`.

/**
 * A tool's chat-surface rendering strategy.
 *
 * Four kinds, because the card mount sites in ToolMessage.tsx come in three
 * custom shapes plus the default:
 *
 * - `{ kind: 'generic' }` — explicit opt-out meaning "no custom card; use the
 *   default collapsed-card rendering". Distinct from a missing table entry,
 *   which is a compile error (see `TOOL_RENDERERS`'s doc comment).
 *
 * - `{ kind: 'replace', render }` — renders *instead of* the whole tool-call
 *   block. Modelled on `SubagentCard` (`ToolMessage.tsx`'s former early
 *   `return`), which takes over the entire call's presentation.
 *
 * - `{ kind: 'body', render }` — renders *inside* the default collapsed
 *   card's content area, below the parameters section. Modelled on
 *   `LiveTaskCard` (`ToolMessage.tsx`'s former `isTerminalLikeRequest`
 *   branch), which augments the generic card rather than replacing it.
 *   Without this variant, terminal-like tools could not be
 *   expressed at all. `terminal_command` is the sole `body` entry —
 *   the CLI `command_execution` capability and the legacy
 *   `delegate_external_agent` name also mount `LiveTaskCard`, but neither is
 *   tool-name-indexed, so both stay as inline branches in `ToolMessage.tsx`
 *   rather than table entries (see that file's own comment at the mount
 *   site).
 *
 * - `{ kind: 'content', render }` — renders *as* the default card's whole
 *   content area: it replaces both the "参数" (arguments JSON) section and
 *   the "结果" (result JSON) section, while the header, the collapse
 *   toggle, and the approval / running footers stay exactly as they are for
 *   every other tool. The file-editing tools (`fs_edit`, `fs_write`,
 *   `edit_file`, `write_file`) are its only entries: their expanded
 *   card shows a diff of what the call actually changed, and neither of the
 *   two JSON blocks it replaces adds anything a diff doesn't already say —
 *   `oldText`/`newText`/`content` *are* the diff, spelled as escaped JSON.
 *
 *   `body` cannot express this: it is defined as "append below the default
 *   sections", so a `body` renderer would leave the arguments JSON sitting
 *   above the diff (and, once the call succeeds, the result JSON too).
 *   `replace` overshoots in the other direction — it takes over the header
 *   and the approval footer as well, which these tools must keep: a pending
 *   file write still needs its Allow/Reject row and its `+N/-M` headline.
 *
 * Any `render` may return `null` for a particular call/state to fall back
 * to the default rendering — e.g. `delegate_subagent`'s renderer returns
 * `null` while pending approval, matching current behavior where the approval
 * footer (not `SubagentCard`) owns that state; the file-editing `content`
 * renderer returns `null` for every status `resolveFileChangeRows` does not
 * draw, so a failed or rejected write still shows its error/rejection
 * section verbatim.
 *
 * `summary` is orthogonal to `kind` — a `generic`-kind tool can still
 * have a custom header summary (most of them do); see `ToolChatSummaryFn`'s
 * own doc comment above.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT modelled here: `CliSubagentCard` (`ToolMessage.tsx`'s
 * `cliSubagent.presentation && actions && sessionRef` branch). That gate is
 * a capability/state condition, not a tool name — so it is not a by-name
 * concern and stays out of this table.
