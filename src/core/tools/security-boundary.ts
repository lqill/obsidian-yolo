 * Throws with the exact same messages the pre-registry inline checks threw.
 * Callers must run this inside the same try/catch that normalizes thrown
 * errors into a tool error result — it does not catch anything itself.
 *
 * DO NOT inline this into a single tool's `execute` — it must stay reachable
 * from every call path, manual-approval and direct-call included ("this is
