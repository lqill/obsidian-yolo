/**
 * The single registration point for all built-in capabilities.
 *
 * This is the only place a new capability needs to be registered.
 *
 * Registration order is also display order: the settings page renders
 * capabilities within a category in this array's order, with no separate
 * `BUILTIN_TOOL_DISPLAY_ORDER` table. Order below is grouped by category and
 * matches the historical display order exactly —
 * vault: fs_read -> bash -> fs_edit_ops; context: context_prune_tool_results
 * -> context_compact -> ask_user_question -> todo_write;
 * external: web_ops -> js_eval -> terminal_command -> delegate_subagent (the
 * external category's former `BUILTIN_TOOL_DISPLAY_ORDER` list, and the
 * vault/context orders' former natural-registration/DOM order) — see the
 * capability-row-order regression test in
 * `AgentsSectionContent.capability-rows.test.ts`.
