/**
 * Semantic vault retrieval as a first-class capability.
 *
 * It used to exist only as attachments to other capabilities — the virtual
 * shell's custom `search` subcommand and `js_eval`'s `$db.search` — which
 * left Max, where both of those are withheld, with no semantic retrieval at
 * all. It is also the wrong shape: reaching the vault's vector index is not
 * a shell builtin, and a model had to know about `bash` first to find it.
 *
 * `chatModes` covers all three built-in modes. Ask's promise is "do not
 * change my vault", not "do not read it", and this capability cannot write.
 * No `isAvailable`: `runVaultSearchStructured` degrades to keyword ranking
 * when no embedding model or knowledge base is configured, so the tool is
 * useful in every vault — the degradation comes back as `fallbackReason` on
 * the result rather than as a missing tool.
 *
 * Approval matches `file_reading`: reading the vault is the same act here,
 * whichever index answers it.
