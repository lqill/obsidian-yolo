/**
 * Direct local-filesystem access, desktop-only.
 *
 * These are a *separate identity* from the vault-backed `file_reading` /
 * `file_editing` capabilities rather than an extra mode of them: the vault
 * tools' whole contract — vault-relative paths, wikilink resolution, the
 * editor buffer staying consistent — is what makes them safe for the Agent
 * mode community relies on, and nothing here shares it. Keeping the two
 * apart is also what lets a mode grant one without the other.
 *
 * `category: 'external'` for the same reason `terminal` is external: the
 * reach is the user's machine, not the vault. `defaultEnabled: true` with
 * `approval.defaultMode: 'full_access'` is the Max standard trust tier —
 * the boundary that actually matters (a write outside the vault) is
 * enforced by the gateway, not by an all-or-nothing settings toggle.
