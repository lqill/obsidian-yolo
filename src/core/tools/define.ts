/**
 * Literal-preserving constructors for tool and capability definitions.
 *
 * HARD CONSTRAINT ("字面量保持"):
 * every tool/capability definition MUST be built through `defineTool` /
 * `defineCapability` below. Writing `const x: BuiltinToolDefinition = {...}`
 * instead is FORBIDDEN — an explicit type annotation widens `name`/`id` to
 * plain `string`, which silently degrades `BuiltinToolName` /
 * `BuiltinCapabilityId` (registry.ts) to `string` and defeats every
 * completeness check (duplicate-name assertions, the two exhaustive wiring
 * tables) this whole project exists to add. If you find yourself
 * reaching for a type annotation here, stop — use these instead.
 */

/**
 * `Name` is inferred from the literal `name` field and stays a literal (e.g.
 * `'memory_add'`) rather than widening to `string`, because a type parameter
 * *constrained to* `string` suppresses literal widening at its inference
 * site. No `const` type-parameter modifier is needed (or used) for that —
 * and it must not be added back: the repo's esbuild (0.17.3) predates TS 5.0
 * `const` type parameters (0.17.5+), so it would type-check under tsc but
 * fail `npm run build` at bundle time. `src/core/tools/literal-preservation.test-d.ts`
 * pins the behavior this comment claims.

 * `name`. Without this, `capability.tools[number].name` would type-check as
