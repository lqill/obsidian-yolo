// every unchanged line, so rows built without folding would carry the whole
// file into whatever persists them (a CLI call's `request.metadata`). The
// card only draws what it is handed.
//
// Budget allocation across files: each file gets its own budget. A call that
// touches several files builds one `FileChangeRows` per file with the same
// per-file limits a single-file call has, so no file's diff depends on which
// other files happened to share its call, and the multi-file list expands one
// file at a time by default — the render cost of what is on screen stays that
// of a single file.
