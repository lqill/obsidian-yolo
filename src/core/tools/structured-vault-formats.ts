// A vault path's extension is signal enough on its own for the host to say
// "this isn't freeform text" — the same signal `fs_read` already hardcodes
// for pdf/docx/pptx/xlsx (see `fs_read/schema-helpers.ts`'s
// `getOfficeDocumentKindFromExtension`). Recognizing an extension string
// does not require importing the module that interprets its bytes; this file
// owns exactly that string-level boundary, shared by `fs_edit` and
// `fs_write` (both need it — "谁用它谁收留" only moves a helper into a
// single tool's own directory when that tool is its only consumer).
//
// The check this file backs is UNCONDITIONAL — independent of whether the
// owning module is installed or active. The alternative (only blocking when the module happens to be active) would
// make the same fs_edit call on the same file behave differently on two
// machines depending on which modules are installed there — worse than a
// missing feature, because it's an inconsistency the model (and the user
// reading its output) has no way to predict. That's also why this is a
// static table rather than a query against `ModuleFileTextRendererRegistry`
// (the read-side registry): registration there is runtime/module-driven by
// design, and reusing it here would make the write-side guard only as
// reliable as "did the module happen to load before this call."
