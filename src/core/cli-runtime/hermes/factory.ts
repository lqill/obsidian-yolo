/**
 * Builds the Hermes runtime factory. One `AcpHostPool` is shared by every
 * Hermes `CliRuntime` this factory creates, keyed by profile id — a
 * profile can only be selected when its process is launched (`hermes -p
 * <profile> acp`), so two conversations under different profiles must get
 * two separate subprocesses, not the single shared host this pool used to
 * hand out unconditionally. Each key's host is created lazily on first
 * acquire and disposed once nothing still references it (see
 * `AcpHostPool`'s reference counting) — Hermes is a non-trivial Python
 * process, so idle profiles are reclaimed rather than kept forever.
 *
 * Command resolution re-runs on every host respawn, so an install or path
 * override picked up after startup takes effect on the next attempt without
 * restarting Obsidian.
