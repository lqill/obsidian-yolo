/**
 * Builds the CodeBuddy Code runtime over the CLI's own ACP server.
 *
 * Every conversation shares one pooled subprocess: CodeBuddy has no profile
 * concept to key hosts by (unlike Hermes), and ACP already multiplexes
 * sessions over a single connection. The pool's reference counting still
 * earns its place — CodeBuddy is a large Node process, so it is reclaimed
 * once no conversation still binds it rather than kept alive for the
 * lifetime of the plugin.
 *
 * Command resolution re-runs on every host respawn, so installing CodeBuddy
 * or setting a path override after startup takes effect on the next attempt
 * without restarting Obsidian.
