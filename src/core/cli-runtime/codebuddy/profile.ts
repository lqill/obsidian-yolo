 * CodeBuddy Code's ACP plug-in point: `codebuddy --acp` over stdio.
 *
 * Authentication is deliberately absent. Every method CodeBuddy advertises
 * (iOA, Google/GitHub, WeChat, enterprise domain) completes in a browser or
 * on a phone, which an Obsidian pane cannot host, so this profile never
 * calls `authenticate` and the agent runs on whatever credential the CLI
 * already cached — the user logs in once by running `codebuddy` in a
 * terminal, or supplies `CODEBUDDY_API_KEY` for the enterprise build.
 * Until then `session/new` fails with CodeBuddy's own "Authentication
 * required" error, which surfaces to the user as-is.

   * - `bypassPermissions` — skip approval prompts for the session.

   * even under bypass, for dangerous commands) and is not reachable from the
   * product's YOLO toggle: YOLO means "stop asking me", not "disarm the
   * agent's own safety floor". `auto`, `dontAsk` and `delegate` describe
