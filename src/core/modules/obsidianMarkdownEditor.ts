// The one place in the repository that reaches into Obsidian's internals.
//
// Obsidian renders Markdown live (formatting shown, markup hidden away from
// the cursor) with a large set of private CodeMirror extensions, and does not
// publish the editor component that carries them. `MarkdownRenderer` covers
// read-only rendering; there is no public counterpart for editing. Rebuilding
// live preview ourselves would mean reimplementing Obsidian's editor, so
// instead we borrow the component the way Obsidian's own Canvas does — the
// same approach several long-standing community plugins take.
//
// The route: ask the embed registry for a Markdown embed, put it in edit mode,
// and walk up from the instance it creates to the base class it derives from.
// That class is then constructed directly into a container of our choosing;
// the embed itself is discarded, because a live embed also carries a preview
// pane and its own chrome that an embedded editor should not drag along.
//
// Everything private is confined to this file, behind types the rest of the
// host uses. The traversal and the shape check are separate pure functions so
// they can be tested against fakes, and each failure names the step that broke
// — when a future Obsidian changes shape, the error should say where.

 * board: `scrollTop` is CSS pixels, the block map is screen pixels. Measured
 * 2026-09-02 at 1.107×: with source line 51 at the top edge, `getScroll` read
 * 45.76; `applyScroll(49)` landed on line 28, because it also scrolls to
 * heights that are still estimates. Obsidian's own Canvas drifts the same
 * way, a line per round trip at its zoom. The CodeMirror view underneath is

 * scrolling inside the editor throws on each event.
