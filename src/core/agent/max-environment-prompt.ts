- Paths may be absolute, start with ~, or be relative to the working directory.
- A file path or a terminal cwd outside the working directory may pause for the user's approval, which they can then grant for the rest of this chat. Stay inside unless the task is genuinely about a path elsewhere.
- Shell output is truncated before you see it. Narrow it at the source (| head, | rg, | wc -l) instead of printing everything.
