# Repository Guidelines

This is a fork of YOLO, focusing on adding gemini live api capabilities.

YOLO is an Obsidian plugin for AI chat, agent workflows, RAG, writing assistance, and independently shipped product modules such as FSRS-based Learning and the Whiteboard infinite canvas.

For a behavior ↔ code-location ↔ verification-path index (complements this file's directory-ownership rules, doesn't restate them), see `FEATURE_MAP.md`.

## Commands

Verify what you touched: host code → type-check + relevant tests; module code → module typecheck, tests, `npm --prefix modules/<id> run test:boundary` when available, and module build; runtime component code → runtime typecheck, tests, build, and verify; host CSS → styles build (module CSS is rebuilt by the module build).

- `npm run dev` - Build runtime components and first-party modules, then watch the host app, host styles, and dev-vault artifacts
- `npm run build` - Production build with host, module, and runtime component type checking; run for changes affecting production bundling, module boundaries, runtime loading, or cross-platform behavior
- `npm run type:check` / `npm run module:typecheck` / `npm run runtime:typecheck` - Type-check the host, first-party modules, or runtime components
- `npm run module:build` - Rebuild first-party module artifacts and the bundled module catalog
- `npm run runtime:build` / `npm run runtime:verify` - Rebuild runtime component artifacts and their registry, or verify the host bundle doesn't statically pull in a runtime component's dependencies
- `npm run lint:check` / `npm run lint:fix` - Check or fix Prettier and ESLint
- `npm test` - Run the full Jest suite; use `npx jest <test-file> --runInBand` for serial debugging
- `npm run styles:build` - Regenerate the host `styles.css` from `src/styles/**`
- `npm run deps:check` - Enforce the circular-dependency ratchet; after removing cycles, tighten the baseline with `npm run deps:baseline`

## Architecture

- `src/main.ts` owns the host plugin lifecycle. `src/ChatView.tsx` and `src/components/chat-view/` own the main chat surface.
- `src/core/modules/` owns module discovery, installation, loading, activation, lifecycle, and the versioned Host API. `modules/host-sdk.d.ts` is the module-facing API contract.
- `modules/<id>/` owns everything in a product module: its UI, domain logic, host adapters, styles, assets, workers, and tests. `modules/learning/` and `modules/whiteboard/` hold the complete Learning and Whiteboard implementations.
- `src/core/runtime-components/` owns discovery, download, and lifecycle of on-demand runtime components. `runtime-components/<id>/` at the repo root owns each component's source and build output; `runtime-components/sdk.d.ts` is the component-facing contract.
- `src/core/agent/` owns the shared native agent runtime, tool gateway, conversation service, subagents, and background tasks. `NativeAgentRuntime` is the one orchestration; its consumers are `AgentSessionService` (chat surfaces), `AgentRunApi` in `agent-api.ts` (programmatic callers, modules included), and `subagent/runner.ts`. A caller without a chat view goes through `agent-api.ts` and states a trust tier as `capability` (`none` / `vault-read` / `vault-write`, in `capability-profile.ts`) instead of hand-assembling tools or an `AgentSessionService.run` input; chat modes resolve through `resolveChatModeRuntime` (`chat-runtime-profiles.ts`).
- `src/core/cli-runtime/` owns the external CLI agent runtimes the chat surface can switch to. They are a separate execution surface alongside `AgentSessionService`, not a second orchestration of it, and are desktop-only — keep their implementations out of the mobile static graph.
- `src/core/realtime/` owns the Gemini Live voice surface: the BidiGenerateContent transport, mic capture and playback, and its per-turn state machine. It is a third execution surface beside the agent and the CLI runtimes and never calls `AgentSessionService.run`; its only shared seams are the chat mode's tool grant (`voiceToolBridge`, which must carry the same workspace/skill/command boundary the text agent gets), the conversation write-back (`ChatSessionController.upsertConversationMessages`), and one place to publish assistant text — `AgentSessionService`'s external assistant stream, the same render stream the agent uses. Read its state only through `src/core/realtime/useRealtimeVoice.ts`; `voiceSessionStore` is module-private, and `Chat.tsx` is the single place that turns "a session is live" into picker locks and the `getRealtimeSurface` port.
- `src/core/ai/single-turn.ts` is the low-latency path for Sparkle (tab completion, selection rewrite, continuation). Do not route these features through the agent runtime.
- `src/core/tools/` owns every built-in tool: `capabilities/` is the single registration point, and the tool catalog, settings rows, approval policy, persisted keys, and the chat summary classification are all derived from it — never add a side table. `dispatcher.ts` is the only execution path. Deferred disclosure is the only mode: a tool outside the request's `tools` array is reached through the protocol-internal `invoke_tool` / `load_tool_schemas`, which carry no capability and never appear in settings. Evaluate approval and every other per-tool policy against the unwrapped call, never the wrapper.
- `src/core/llm/`, `auth/`, `rag/`, `mcp/`, and `skills/` own shared model, provider, retrieval, and MCP capabilities.
- `src/features/` contains host-shipped cross-cutting features. `src/database/`, `src/settings/`, and `src/styles/` own host persistence, settings, and global styles.

## Module and Runtime Component Boundaries

- Placement: a large, optional product capability that can be installed, enabled, and released independently goes in `modules/`; a heavy or native/WASM dependency closure goes in `runtime-components/`; anything small or inherently host-integrated stays in `src/features/`.

### Modules

- A module may depend on the versioned Host API and its declared package dependencies. It must not import `src/core/`, `src/components/`, `YoloPlugin`, or `obsidian` directly — repository co-location grants first-party modules no additional access.
- Add a capability to the Host API only when it is broadly useful to modules. Keep module-specific policy and behavior inside the owning module.
- Core must not import module source or bundle module implementation into the host artifact. Communicate only through registration, manifests, and Host API contracts.
- A module ships skills as packages: declared files are projected on activation into `<YOLO base>/modules/<moduleId>/skills/<package>/` and are then ordinary Vault skills. Do not introduce a module-skill path protocol.
- The host's refusal to text-edit a module-owned structured format is an unconditional static extension check (`src/core/tools/structured-vault-formats.ts`); never make it query a runtime registry, or the same call on the same file would behave differently depending on which modules a machine happens to have installed.
- Treat versioned `entry.js`, module `style.css`, generated manifest metadata (hashes, sizes, and URLs), and `modules/bundled.json` as build outputs. Change source or compatibility declarations and run `npm run module:build` rather than editing generated metadata. Versioned artifact directories (`modules/<id>/<version>/`) are git-ignored and never committed — a release rebuilds them and publishes them to GitHub Releases. `modules/bundled.json` is git-ignored too: it is the local catalog only the development build reads.

### Runtime Components

- Never statically import a heavy or native/WASM dependency closure into the host or a module (e.g. tokenizer, PDF, bash, or embedding libraries); `npm run runtime:verify` fails the build if one leaks into the host bundle.
- Build outputs (`runtime-components/*/dist/`) are never committed; `registry.json` is the committed contract declaring each artifact's `byteSize`/`sha256`. The bytes are published content-addressed to the permanent, append-only `runtime-assets` Release and mirrored to R2 — never delete or overwrite an attachment there, since shipped versions baked those hashes.

## Critical Cross-Cutting Constraints

### YOLO Managed Paths

- Resolve host-managed Vault paths from current settings through `src/core/paths/`; never hardcode `YOLO`. Modules consume current path snapshots through the Host API instead of reproducing host path rules.
- Long-lived services must read current settings or path snapshots through getters so base-directory changes take effect without restart.

### Runtime Boundaries

- Never statically import desktop-only dependencies (`node:*`, `proxy-agent`, `shell-env`, local servers, child processes, stream adapters, etc.). Load them with `await import(...)` inside desktop-only branches so mobile can load the host or module.
- The RAG vector store is IndexedDB-backed (`src/database/vector-store/`); schema v1 is final — a schema change requires bumping `VECTOR_DATABASE_VERSION` and adding an upgrade path in `vectorDatabase.ts`.
- Do not create a second chat or agent orchestration path.

### Chat Runtime Invariants

- Agent conversation state is structurally shared: a message object's reference changes if and only if its content changes. Never mutate messages or state arrays in place; dev builds deep-freeze published snapshots to catch this.
- While a message is generating, its content and reasoning live in `assistantRenderStreamStore`, not in the conversation snapshot; snapshots fold the stream back only at semantic boundaries. Never publish per-token conversation snapshots.
- All scroll writes in chat surfaces go through the scroll controller in `src/components/chat-view/scroll/`; never set `scrollTop` directly, and never infer user intent from it — paging direction comes from the input event, position only gates the edge.

### Popout / Multi-window

Obsidian popouts are separate BrowserWindows. Plugin JS still runs in one realm, but each window has its own `document`, `window`, and keymap. Global `document` / `window` are the **main** window.

- View-local DOM work (portals, listeners, `requestAnimationFrame`, `ResizeObserver`, `IntersectionObserver`, `getComputedStyle`, `activeElement`, timers) must use the node's `ownerDocument` / `defaultView`. Use `src/utils/dom/window-context.ts`; do not default to the globals.
- Keyboard, Escape layering, and menus belong to Obsidian's keymap (`Scope` + `app.keymap.pushScope` / `popScope`, `Menu`, `Modal`). A React `onKeyDown` plus Radix/document-capture stack only sees keys that reach a node in that document, so it works in the main window and fails in the popout.
- Overlay, shortcut, and portal behavior is not done until it has been checked in a popout, not only the main window.

## Obsidian and Style Constraints

- React event handlers that call async functions must use `void` wrappers.
- Do not directly set `element.style.cursor` or `element.style.userSelect`; use `setCssProps`.
- Obsidian renders every `aria-label` as a hover tooltip. Use it only where that tooltip is wanted (icon-only buttons); an element that already shows its name as visible text is named by that text or by `aria-labelledby`, never by a duplicate `aria-label`.
- Every `eslint-disable` directive must include a reason.
- All CSS classes must use the `yolo-` prefix. Host styles live in `src/styles/**`; module styles live with their module.
- When styling native controls, assume Obsidian core and theme styles apply globally. Use component-scoped `element.yolo-*` selectors, explicitly reset affected properties, and use `!important` only for a confirmed host-style collision.
- Organize host styles by responsibility as documented in `src/styles/README.md`. Before changing popovers or dropdowns, read the ownership rules in `src/styles/popover/surface.css`.
- Never hardcode user-visible text; route it through i18n, and resolve the current locale at use time rather than caching a locale-bound translator.
- Animate only `opacity` and `transform`, with durations and easings from `src/styles/tokens/motion.css` / `motion.ts` (paired files — keep both in sync). Animating layout properties requires an inline exemption comment.
- CSS animations get reduced-motion handling for free from a global fallback; do not add per-component disable blocks. JS-driven animations (framer-motion / WAAPI) must degrade via `useReducedMotion`.
